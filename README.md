# CS00
CS00 is an online resource for case studies in entrepreneurship. These case studies cover a wide range of legal and business issues raised in a variety of entrepreneurship contexts. Individual, simplified case studies are available in other repositories as Github Pages.

Case studies available allow students and entrepreneurs to explore contemporary issues in entrepreneurship, business, and law. They explore topics as diverse as corporate finance, entity selection, intellectual property licenses, supply chain management, trademark portfolio strategy, and pitch practice amongst others. 

Each case study is taken from real-life scenarios encountered by practicing lawyers; most have been inspired by issues handled by student attorneys in the [University of Wisconsin Law & Entrepreneurship Clinic](http://www.uwle.org). The intent is to allow students, lawyers, entrepreneurs, and other specialists to explore together in teams or individually how these issues arise and their multi-faceted solutions. Most (probably all) use artificial intelligence to help explore these edges and provide realistic feedback. 

## Current Development Roadmap

The current status of this application is very very (very!) MVP (minimum viable product). 

**Phase I** will build the structure around the site and get the first case study (term sheet negotiation for a hard-tech product) online. It will implement an AI Term Sheet Analysis and an AI Negotiation in addition to facilitating a more traditional, "in-class" simulation.

**Phase II** will add collaboration. Case studies like these are often done in team-based classrooms, so users will be able to take a side, work together on documents, analysis, negotiation, strategy, and the other tools developed by these case studies.

**Phase III** will add more advanced AI interactions including defining your own AI, changing difficulty levels, and becoming more adapted to specific users.

Each case study has a robust intstructor manual that will help guide teachers and instructors in the materials and ideas being developed by the modules.

## Technical Background

Based in React with Material Design. Implemented on Vercel with a Supabase backend.
